    "Beckham was born on November 5th, in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. He’s the oldest son from Odell Beckham Sr., that was a standout running back and played at LSU from 1989 to 1992 and Mrs. Heather Van Norman, that also attended LSU as a track runner.",
    "Odell was raised among sports, always encouraged by their parents. When he was just 4 he promised his mother he would play in the NFL. Since very young he already knew that this was his goal.",
    "He attended Isidore Newman School in New Orleans, where he was a letterman in football, basketball, and track. He chose Louisiana State University(LSU) over other scholarship offers to start his career.",
    "As a true freshman at LSU in 2011, Beckham started nine of 14 games. The Tigers made the BCS National Championship game in Beckham's freshman season. Overall, he recorded 41 receptions for 475 yards and two touchdowns. He was named a freshman All-SEC selection.",
    "In 2012, Beckham started 12 of 13 games for the Tigers. In the season, he had his first collegiate career punt return touchdown. He finished the season as the first on the team in receiving yards with 713 and second in receptions with 43.",
    "As a junior in 2013, Beckham was named the winner of the 2013 Paul Hornung Award, presented annually to the most versatile player in major college football. After the season, he decided to forego his senior season and entered the 2014 NFL Draft, being selected by the New York Giants in the first round.",
    "Beckham’s first season in NFL couldn’t begin better. On November, Beckham had 10 catches for 146 yards and two touchdowns in a game, including a one-handed touchdown reception hailed as the \"catch of the year\", being considered by many as one of the best catches ever.",
    "Beckham was named the Associated Press’ Offensive Rookie of the Year, the first Giants player to be so honored in the 58-year history of the award. Beckham also won the award for Play of the Year at NFL Honors as he is the first wide receiver in NFL history to reach 1,000 yards.",
    "In 2016, Beckham was a Pro Bowl selection for a third year in a row. The Giants returned to the playoffs for the first time since 2011. He was ranked 8th by his fellow players on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2017.",
    "On April 24, 2017, the Giants exercised Beckham's fifth year option. In four games, Beckham finished with 25 receptions for 302 yards and three touchdowns. Looking forward to the next season!"
